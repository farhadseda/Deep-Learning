# Deep-Learning

Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning that focuses on learning complex, hierarchical 
feature representations from raw data. The dominant method for achieving this, artificial neural 
networks, has revolutionized the processing of data (e.g. images, videos, text, and audio) as well as 
decision-making tasks (e.g. game-playing). Its success has enabled a tremendous amount of 
practical commercial applications and has had a significant impact on society.
In this course, students will learn the fundamental principles, underlying mathematics, and 
implementation details of deep learning. This includes the concepts and methods used to optimize 
these highly parameterized models (gradient descent and backpropagation, and more generally 
computation graphs), the modules that make them up (linear, convolution, and pooling layers, 
activation functions, etc.), and common neural network architectures (convolutional neural networks, 
recurrent neural networks, etc.). Applications ranging from computer vision to natural language 
processing and decision-making (reinforcement learning) will be demonstrated. Through in-depth 
programming assignments, students will learn how to implement these fundamental building blocks 
as well as how to put them together using a popular deep learning library, PyTorch. In the final 
project, students will apply what they have learned to real-world scenarios by exploring these 
concepts with a problem that they are passionate about.
